File name: inventory.py
Author: Nikesh Chavda
Student ID: NC22110005394
Notes: fixed value error bug as requested by code-reviewer: -
added some defensive programming to prevent the user from entering incorrect
data for the quantity of a shoe, when editing and adding a new one
Assumptions:
Dependencies:
please install the 'tabulate' module to run this code by entering the following line in the terminal: -
pip install tabulate
